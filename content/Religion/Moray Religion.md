### Moray Religion

---

#### **Core Beliefs**
The Moray religion is a deeply spiritual system rooted in dualities, reflecting the struggles of a people caught between light and darkness, freedom and oppression, tradition and evolution. Its pantheon and practices are as diverse as its followers, with two dominant sects: the **Liastali**, worshipers of **Lios**, and the **Randarli**, adherents of **Randarlock**.

### **Cultural and Historical Influence**

#### **Buuku Suppression**
- During the Buuku occupation, Moray religious practices were heavily monitored and diluted:
  - **Randarlock Worship Ban**: Outlawed due to its association with rebellion.
  - **Lios Teachings**: Permitted but regulated under Buuku-appointed Valantari leaders.

#### **Post-Battle of Cardem**
- The aftermath of the battle reshaped Moray spirituality:
  - Many Randarli and Liastali followers chose self-imposed exile, living as wandering nomads.
  - A schism between the sects deepened, reflecting the trauma and destruction of the Esh Kathar.

#### **Diaspora and Evolution**
- In The Belt and other diasporic communities, Moray spirituality has blended with local beliefs, creating unique hybrid practices:
  - **Belter Moray Slang**: Incorporates spiritual terminology, reflecting the cultural fusion of Moray traditions and Belter resilience.
