### The Outer Rim: The Second Asteroid Belt

---

#### **Overview**
- The Outer Rim is the second asteroid belt in the solar system, located beyond Neptune, encompassing regions near Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake.
- Unlike the populated and politically active main Belt, the Outer Rim is a lawless and enigmatic frontier avoided by most Belters.
- It is infamous for its inhospitable conditions, eerie mysteries, and psychological risks, earning a reputation for driving travelers to madness.

#### **Key Characteristics**
- **Environment**:
  - Extreme isolation with vast distances between asteroids, making communication and resupply logistically difficult.
  - Asteroids are composed of ice and rocky materials, with occasional pockets of valuable resources like rare metals.
- **Cultural Perception**:
  - Widely regarded as "haunted" due to countless stories of strange sightings, inexplicable ship disappearances, and psychological effects on those who venture too far.
  - Travelers speak of encountering space monsters or strange, shadowy figures, though these reports are often dismissed as hallucinations or the effects of deep-space isolation.

#### **Population**
- **RimRovers**:
  - A nomadic and highly individualistic group, often labeled as mad by main Belt inhabitants.
  - Includes Moray male nomads, known for their deep spirituality and detachment from traditional Moray society.
  - RimRovers live aboard small, agile spacecraft (Astromites), relying on their self-sufficiency and survival skills.
- **Settlers and Outcasts**:
  - The Outer Rim is home to a scattering of isolated settlers, hermits, and exiles seeking to escape societal structures.
  - These individuals often establish small, hidden enclaves on remote asteroids.

#### **Mysteries and Supernatural Elements**
- **Space Monsters**:
  - Many accounts describe encounters with massive, incomprehensible creatures or fleeting shadowy forms in the void.
  - It is unclear if these are genuine entities, hallucinations induced by stress and isolation, or remnants of ancient technology.
- **Madness**:
  - Travelers often report psychological breakdowns after prolonged exposure to the Outer Rim’s emptiness.
  - Symptoms include paranoia, vivid hallucinations, and an overwhelming sense of dread, attributed to the absence of normal stimuli and extreme isolation.

  - Advanced recycling systems are necessary to sustain life in the Outer Rim, as resupply from the inner system is nearly impossible.
  - Settlements and ships rely on compact nuclear or solar power sources for energy.
- **Hidden Settlements**:
  - Many settlements are built into asteroid caverns to shield inhabitants from space radiation and remain undetected by potential threats.
