#### **Core Ideology**
The Messengers of Rage, led by the enigmatic **Harvester of Sorrow**, are a cult centered on chaos, destruction, and the belief in an ultimate return to the **Void**. Their doctrine combines the teachings of **Randarlock**, the Moray god of chaos and vengeance, with the Harvester’s personal vision of a universe purified through destruction.

1. **The Void**:
   - The Messengers see the Void, personified by the **Children of the Void**, as the origin and ultimate destiny of all existence.
   - They believe chaos is the natural state of the universe, and only by embracing destruction can they transcend the confines of mortal existence.

2. **The Harvester’s Vision**:
   - The Harvester teaches that humanity is destined to enslave and destroy the galaxy, evolving into a "new Buuku" that would subjugate both Buuku and Moray.
   - To prevent this prophecy, the Harvester sees it as his divine duty to annihilate humanity and pave the way for a new life in the Void.
