### The Children of the Void

---

#### **Overview**
The **Children of the Void** are a radical death cult rooted in the Moray Randarli sect and connected to the mythos of *Randarlock*—the Moray deity representing chaos, destruction, and ultimate darkness. Formed after the Battle of Cardem, the cult is made up of **Moray Randarli males** who rejected both the false freedom offered by Cardem’s post-Bukku governance and the broader structures of Moray society, including the Liastali sect. The cult channels the anger of Moray enslavement and centuries of oppression into their ultimate purpose: to herald the birth of the **Harvester of Sorrow** and bring about the return of all existence to the Void.
