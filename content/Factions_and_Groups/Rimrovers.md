### RimRovers: Nomads of the Outer Rim

#### **Overview**

Known for their individualism and resilience, RimRovers thrive in the solitude of space, living on small asteroids or aboard their one-man spacecraft, **Astromites**. While often viewed as mad by more mainstream Belters, the RimRovers embody the ultimate expression of freedom and survival in *The Dark Frontier*.
