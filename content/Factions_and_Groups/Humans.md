### Humans in *The Dark Frontier*

---

#### **Overview**
Humans in *The Dark Frontier* are divided into distinct groups shaped by their environment, culture, and societal structures. The primary factions include Earthside elites, Belt communities, and the nomadic RimRovers. Humanity’s development has been significantly influenced by their interactions with the Bukku Empire, which provided advanced technology in exchange for trade. Despite the collapse of the Bukku Empire, its remnants—namely the Valantari (Moray elites favored by the Bukku) and Bukku oligarchs—continue to wield power over Earthside governance and human societies.

### **Earthside Humans**

#### **Society and Governance**
- **Earth Alliance**:
  - The Earth Alliance governs Earthside, which includes Earth, its colonies (Moon, Mars, Venus platforms), and surrounding orbital infrastructure.
  - Operates as a centralized and highly authoritarian entity, exerting control through its military arm, the **Earth Alliance Space Army (EASA)**.
    - **EASA’s Role**:
      - Maintains order across Earthside colonies and attempts to extend Earth’s influence into The Belt.
      - Enforces strict laws and high taxes on trade, ensuring Earthside dominance over outer colonies.
      - Known for corruption and heavy-handed tactics, particularly in suppressing rebellion and dissent in The Belt.

- **Bukku Influence**:
  - The Bukku Empire never conquered the Sol system due to its remoteness, but it established trade relations with Earthside elites.
  - In exchange for rare minerals and cultural artifacts, the Bukku provided advanced technologies that revolutionized Earthside:
    - **Colony Development**: Enabled the construction of massive colonies on Venus platforms, Moon, and Mars.
    - **Surveillance Systems**: Introduced the technology for Earthside’s pervasive surveillance networks, which monitor and control its population.
  - Following the Bukku Empire’s recent collapse, its former agents—the Valantari and Bukku oligarchs—exert significant influence on Earthside politics and economy:
    - **Valantari**: Former Moray collaborators with the Bukku, these elites align themselves with Earthside rulers to retain power.
    - **Bukku Oligarchs**: Wealthy Bukku figures who manipulate Earthside elites to maintain their status in the post-empire era.

#### **Class Divide**
- **Elites**:
  - Comprising corporate magnates, Earth Alliance officials, and influential families.
  - They live in luxury on Earth, Venus orbital platforms, or Eros Colony.
  - Their interests align closely with the Valantari and Bukku oligarchs, enabling them to exploit the lower classes and The Belt for resources.
- **Middle Class**:
  - Professionals maintaining Earth’s infrastructure and operating in industries tied to the Earth Alliance.
  - Have limited upward mobility and increasingly resent the elites’ dominance.
- **Lower Class**:
  - Confined to pod apartments with little autonomy or opportunity, relying on government stipends.
  - Disillusionment with Earthside governance fuels underground resistance movements.

#### **Culture**
- **Virtual Escapism**:
  - The majority of Earthside citizens spend much of their lives in virtual realities, avoiding their constrained and isolated lives.
- **Propaganda and Surveillance**:
  - The Earth Alliance uses Bukku-derived surveillance systems to monitor dissent and perpetuate propaganda glorifying Earthside’s dominance.
- **Technological Dependence**:
  - Earthside’s population relies heavily on automation, leading to a loss of practical survival skills and further alienation from outer colonies.

### **The Belt Communities**

#### **Society and Governance**
- **Autonomy**:
  - The Belt is a collection of loosely connected colonies, each operating under its own rules, often resisting Earthside control.
  - Governance varies:
    - **Vesta**: Joint human-Moray council.
    - **Hygiea**: Anarchic, governed by mutual agreements and militias.
    - **Ceres**: Dominated by Earthside-aligned corporations.
- **Diverse Population**:
  - Includes miners, traders, refugees, and Moray settlers.
  - Belters value freedom and self-reliance, contrasting sharply with Earthside’s centralized control.

#### **Culture**
- **Fusion of Traditions**:
  - Interaction with Moray settlers creates hybrid traditions in festivals, art, and language.
- **Resilience and Community**:
  - Life in The Belt fosters tight-knit communities where mutual aid is critical for survival.

#### **Economy**
- **Resource Extraction**:
  - The Belt’s economy depends on mining rare materials, traded with Earthside or between colonies.
- **Smuggling**:
  - Many Belters engage in illicit trade to bypass Earth Alliance taxes and regulations.

#### **Challenges**
- **Earthside Influence**:
  - The Earth Alliance’s military (EASA) and corporations attempt to impose control, creating tension and rebellion.
- **Internal Rivalries**:
  - Factional conflicts, including gang wars and disputes over resources, occasionally destabilize colonies.

### **RimRovers**

#### **Society**
- **Nomadic Lifestyles**:
  - RimRovers inhabit the Outer Rim, rejecting structured societies in favor of isolation.
  - Includes Moray male nomads who practice ancient spiritual rituals and have minimal interaction with others.
- **Individualism**:
  - Each RimRover is self-reliant, valuing freedom above all else.
- **Perception**:
  - Viewed as eccentric or mad by Earthside and Belt communities due to their isolated existence and rumored encounters with supernatural phenomena.

#### **Culture**
- **Oral Traditions**:
  - Stories of encounters with space monsters and strange phenomena are shared among RimRovers, blending myth and experience.
- **Mysticism**:
  - Many RimRovers adopt spiritual practices, often influenced by Moray religion or the eerie environment of the Outer Rim.

#### **Economy and Survival**
- **Scavenging**:
  - RimRovers survive by scavenging derelict ships and asteroids, trading goods with trusted partners.
- **Barter Economy**:
  - Reliance on barter systems minimizes the need for currency or centralized trade.

#### **Challenges**
- **Isolation**:
  - Extreme isolation in the Outer Rim leads to mental and physical challenges, including hallucinations and psychological strain.
- **Supernatural Risks**:
  - Encounters with space monsters and other phenomena, real or imagined, contribute to the dangers of RimRover life.
