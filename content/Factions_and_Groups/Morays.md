### The Moray: A Complex and Divided People

---

#### **Overview**
The Moray are a highly spiritual and culturally rich species originating from the desert worlds of Cardem and Mellessa. Once subjugated by the expansive Bukku Empire, they experienced centuries of oppression before achieving a precarious freedom. The Moray people are now scattered across the cosmos, with a significant presence in The Belt and other remote colonies.

### **Historical and Cultural Divisions**

#### **Pre-Bukku Era**
- **Randarli and Liastali**:
  - The two dominant sects in Moray society before Bukku conquest.
  - **Randarli**: Worshippers of Randarlock, a god of defiance and chaos, often engaging in rituals involving human sacrifice.
  - **Liastali**: Devout followers of Lirasta, the god of freedom and spiritual purity. They rejected the Randarli's practices and dominated Moray governance pre-conquest  .

#### **Bukku Subjugation**
- **Enslavement**:
  - The Bukku enslaved the Moray, suppressing their culture and outlawing Randarlock worship while tolerating Lirasta under strict surveillance.
  - Moray women were scattered throughout the Bukku Empire, often forced into servitude as "joy units," while Moray men were systematically culled to maintain control.
- **Valantari**:
  - A new elite class of Moray created by the Bukku to serve as political and religious overseers. The Valantari betrayed their people to maintain their power, eroding traditional Moray values  .

#### **The Battle of Cardem**
- A desperate conflict for freedom, during which Moray men unleashed their Esh Kathars, shadowy entities tied to their spiritual anguish.
- The Esh Kathars caused chaos, forcing a temporary alliance between Bukku and Moray forces to contain the devastation.
- After the battle, many Moray men adopted nomadic lives out of guilt and shame, becoming spiritual wanderers, while Moray women sought freedom by scattering to the outer reaches of the galaxy  .

### **Post-Battle Migration and Present Day**

#### **Moray Women in The Belt**
- Many Moray women, particularly the Tara Karami, sought independence in The Belt, settling on Vesta and other asteroids. They formed tight-knit communities and integrated with Belter societies  .
- These women are known for their resilience and leadership, often taking prominent roles in Belter governance and cultural preservation.

#### **Moray Men: The Nomadic Liastali**
- After the Battle of Cardem, Moray men largely adopted nomadic lives as penitents and spiritual seekers.
- They are particularly prominent in the Outer Rim, living among the RimRovers and practicing ancient Liastali rites.

#### **Valantari Influence**
- The Valantari remain a divisive force, with many aligned with the Bukku oligarchs. Their betrayal of traditional Moray values has left deep scars in the culture.
- Despite the Bukku Empire’s collapse, the Valantari continue to exert influence over Moray populations, often serving as intermediaries for Bukku elites or Earthside leaders  .
