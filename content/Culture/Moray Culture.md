### Moray Culture

#### **Overview**
The Moray culture is shaped by a blend of deep spiritual traditions, resilience born from subjugation, and the adaptation required by their diaspora. Originating from the desert planets of **Cardem** and **Mellessa**, the Moray are a people of stark contrasts: divided by their adherence to differing spiritual beliefs yet unified by a shared history of survival and transformation.
